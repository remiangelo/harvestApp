# Harvest App - Claude Memory

## Project Overview
**Harvest** is a React Native dating app built with Expo and TypeScript, focused on "Mindful Dating, Real Connections". The app features a comprehensive onboarding flow, swipe-based matching, and is preparing for launch to 5-10k users.

## CRITICAL UI REQUIREMENTS
**IMPORTANT**: The liquid glass UI implementation MUST follow the UI mockups in the `Harvest Screens SVG:PNG/` folder **EXACTLY 1:1**. Do not deviate from the mockup designs - all glass effects, blur levels, colors, spacing, and visual elements must match the mockups precisely.

## Current Tech Stack Analysis (As of July 2025)

### **Architecture**
- **Framework**: Expo Router (~5.1.3) with React Native 0.79.5
- **Navigation**: File-based routing with stack navigation
- **State Management**: React Context API for user state
- **Styling**: StyleSheet-based styling with custom themes
- **Backend**: Supabase integration (configured but using demo data)

### **Current Dependencies**
- React 19.0.0, React Native 0.79.5, Expo ~53.0.17
- Navigation: Expo Router, React Navigation
- UI: Expo Vector Icons, React Native Reanimated ~3.17.4
- Utils: Image picker, date/time picker, slider components
