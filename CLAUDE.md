â”œâ”€â”€ onboarding/           # 11-step onboarding flow
â”œâ”€â”€ _tabs/               # Tab navigation screens
â””â”€â”€ index.tsx            # Entry point

components/              # Reusable UI components (ProfileCard, etc.)
context/                 # React Context providers (UserContext)
data/                    # Demo user data and profiles
constants/               # App configuration and Supabase client
```

### **Current Features**
1. **Authentication**: Demo login with predefined users
2. **Onboarding**: Multi-step profile setup (age, bio, photos, preferences)
3. **Swipe Cards**: Basic ProfileCard component with photo navigation
4. **Profile Management**: User context with demographic data
5. **Tab Navigation**: Main app interface structure

### **Demo Users**
- `demo@harvest.com` / `demo123` (completed onboarding)
- `admin@harvest.com` / `admin123` (admin role)
- `test@harvest.com` / `test123` (test user)

## Recommended Tech Stack Upgrades

### **Priority Upgrades**
1. **State Management**: Context API â†’ **Zustand**
   - Better performance, no unnecessary re-renders
   - Simpler API, built-in persistence
   - Excellent TypeScript support

2. **Gesture Handling**: Basic TouchableOpacity â†’ **React Native Gesture Handler v2**
   - Native 60fps animations
   - Advanced gestures for smooth swiping
   - Better UX with haptic feedback

3. **Animation**: Basic animations â†’ **React Native Reanimated v3**
   - Shared values for UI thread performance
   - Spring animations for natural motion
   - Perfect integration with gesture handling

4. **Development Tools**: Add modern workflow
   - ESLint, Prettier, Husky for code quality
   - Flipper for advanced debugging
   - Performance monitoring tools

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Supabase**: Confirmed as optimal choice
- **Cost**: $25-100/month for 5-10k users (75-90% savings vs custom)
- **Features**: Real-time, auth, storage, edge functions
- **Enhanced Schema**: Proper indexing, constraints, advanced tables

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Tech Stack Modernization (Weeks 1-4)**
- Week 1: Modern state management and dev tools
- Week 2: Supabase foundation with enhanced schema
- Week 3: Advanced swipe experience with gestures
- Week 4: Real-time chat and matching system

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)**
- Week 5: Premium features and matching intelligence
- Week 6: Enhanced chat and social features
- Week 7: Push notifications and engagement
- Week 8: Profile enhancements and analytics

### **Phase 3: Launch Preparation (Weeks 9-12)**
- Week 9: Comprehensive testing and QA
- Week 10: App store preparation and CI/CD
- Week 11: Beta testing and user feedback
- Week 12: Launch and monitoring

## Implementation Priority

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Install Zustand and modern dependencies
2. Set up development tools (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
3. Create Supabase project with enhanced schema
4. Implement gesture handler and reanimated

### **Key Files to Modernize**
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Auth state management with Zustand
- `app/login.tsx` - Real authentication
- `app/_tabs/index.tsx` - Advanced swipe interface
- `components/ProfileCard.tsx` - Enhanced with gestures
- Create `stores/` directory for Zustand stores
- Create `lib/supabase.ts` for backend integration

## Cost Analysis
- **Current**: Demo/development phase
- **5K users**: ~$43/month (Supabase Pro + optimized storage)
- **10K users**: ~$102/month (includes additional database)
- **Savings**: 75-90% vs custom AWS backend

## Success Metrics
- **Week 4**: Modern stack implemented, real-time chat working
- **Week 8**: Full features with premium options, 100+ beta users
- **Week 12**: App store approval, 500+ active users, revenue stream
