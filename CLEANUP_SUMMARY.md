# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Column Name Consistency ✅
- Fixed `lib/profiles.ts` updateProfile function to use correct column names:
  - `first_name` → `nickname` (matching migration 003)
  - `city` → `location` 
  - `max_distance` → `distance_preference`
- Added support for `preferences` and `goals` fields

### 2. Unused Files Marked ✅
The following components were marked as UNUSED (replaced by CleanSwipeCard.tsx):
- `components/SwipeCard.tsx`
- `components/EnhancedSwipeCard.tsx`
- `components/ProfileCard.tsx`
- `components/MockupSwipeCard.tsx`
- `components/SwipeableProfileCard.tsx`
- `components/GardenerChat.tsx` (feature not yet implemented)

### 3. Console Statements ✅
- Reviewed all console.error/warn statements
- All are appropriate error handling logs
- No unnecessary console.log statements found

### 4. TypeScript Type Consistency ✅
- `UserProfile` interface correctly matches database schema
- `DemoProfile` uses `name` field (for demo data)
- Database/UserProfile uses `nickname` field
- Proper mapping exists where needed (e.g., `nickname || name || 'User'`)

### 5. Active Components
Currently used swipe card implementation:
- `components/CleanSwipeCard.tsx` - Main swipe card component
- `components/OptimizedImage.tsx` - Image loading with optimization

## Database Schema (from migration 003)
```sql
users table:
- id (UUID)
- email (TEXT)
- nickname (TEXT)
- age (INTEGER)
- bio (TEXT)
- location (TEXT)
- gender (TEXT)
- preferences (TEXT)
- goals (TEXT)
- photos (TEXT[])
- hobbies (TEXT[])
- distance_preference (INTEGER)
- onboarding_completed (BOOLEAN)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

## Important Notes
1. Run `/supabase/quick_fix_schema.sql` to ensure database matches expected schema
2. The `first_name` column was removed in migration 003 - use `nickname` instead
3. All unused swipe card components can be deleted if desired (already marked as UNUSED)
4. The codebase is now consistent and clean
